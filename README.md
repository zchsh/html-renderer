# html-renderer

A test project to render HTML to various formats.

## 2021-01-16 - Deployed to Heroku

- Slug size is kinda big, not sure what to do about it
- Works though, that's nice
- Multi-page PDFs would be cool
- Possible replacement for `wh` stuff, which currently uses `html-pdf` which uses PhantomJS, which is deprecated
